Write a robust Python script that:\n- reads NDJSON from stdin,\n- filters records where rule_level ≥ 10 or mitreid is not null,\n- outputs NDJSON,\n- includes argparse, logging, and unit tests.
Produce a 900–1,200 word mini-report: 'History of Transformer Models (2017–2025)'. Use section headers, numbered references, and a concluding 'Key Takeaways' list of 10 items.
Translate this to English and then explain it for a non-technical audience in 5 bullets:\n« Les compteurs intelligents doivent conserver au moins 13 mois de profils de charge et journaliser les événements de fraude. »
